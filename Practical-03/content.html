        Moco is tech genius that joined Horizon, the most prestigious tech
        company on the continent. But when she finds out they are up to
        nefarious acts, she pulls a disappearing act, wipes her identity from
        the public record and goes into hiding to find a way to stop their
        plans. She likes to operate alone, but will soon realize this threat is
        too big for her to take on by herself.
